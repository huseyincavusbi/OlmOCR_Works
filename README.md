# OlmOCR_Works

This repository contains two notebooks for batch processing images with OCR and compiling the results into a PDF. The olmocr-llama-cpp-python.ipynb notebook uses the llama-cpp-python library for inference, while the OlmOCR_4bit_batch_Inference.ipynb notebook utilizes the unsloth library for a 4-bit quantized approach.
